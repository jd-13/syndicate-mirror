Known issues (as of 0.0.17):
- Multiband visualiser is inaccurate
- MIDI isn't handled consistently in different split types
- [macOS] Macro names can't be edited after resizing the main window until the window is closed and opened again (this is to workaround a weird Logic Pro bug discussed here https://forum.juce.com/t/bug-m1-apple-silicon-keyboard-focus-lost-permanently-in-logic-when-plugin-is-resized/51292)
- Moving a crossover to the highest possible frequency causes an audible glitch
